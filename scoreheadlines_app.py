"""
Streamlit app developed for ADSP 32026 - Score Headlines Project

This app allows users to input a headline and receive a score based on the sentiment of the headline. 
The sentiment is determined by a pre-trained SVM model that uses a pre-trained sentence transformer model to encode the headline and return a score.

The app is built using Streamlit and the FastAPI API.
